# üß© 6 Devs, 1 Project

Welcome to **6 Devs, 1 Project** ‚Äî a collaborative experiment where **six developers** team up to build **one product** in a high-energy, relay-style format. Think of it as a dev jam meets reality show meets Product Hunt launch.

---

## üî• The Mission

To explore what's possible when six minds build one product together ‚Äî one dev at a time, one piece at a time. The outcome? A functional, creative, and possibly launch-worthy MVP in just **12 hours** of combined dev time.

## üß† First Developer: Start Here

As the **first dev**, you're not writing code ‚Äî you're **setting the foundation**.

### Your responsibilities:
1. **Choose a concept** from our shared idea pool (see below).
2. **Define the MVP**: What is the *minimum* viable version we want to ship?
3. **Create the PDR (Project Definition Report)**:
   - Project name & concept
   - Target audience
   - MVP feature list
   - Tech stack suggestions
   - Design direction (if relevant)
   - Handoff plan for Dev #2

Deliver this in a format that's easy to reference: a Notion doc, Google Doc, or markdown file in the repo ‚Äî your choice.

Once you're done:
- **Dev #2** will build the frontend skeleton.  
- **Dev #3** will add design and branding.  
- **Dev #4** handles backend and APIs.  
- **Dev #5** sets up auth and security.  
- **Dev #6** does QA and launches the app live, ready for testing and launching on Product Hunt.

## üí° Project Ideas

Choose one of these or remix your own. Innovation and weirdness are encouraged.

### 1. **Loveable Date Planner**
A web app for couples to discover "vibe-coded" date ideas based on mood, time, and energy.
- Inspired by Loveable.dev
- AI-generated creative ideas
- Shareable date cards or lists

### 2. **Google Maps Trip Companion**
Turns a **Google Maps shared list** into a day-by-day travel itinerary.
- Uses shared "saved places" lists
- Organizes by area, hours, interests
- Could include local insights/weather

### 3. **Voice Translator, But Make It You**
Record your voice once and speak fluently in other languages using your own tone.
- Combines voice cloning + AI translation
- Useful for travel, business, accessibility

### 4. **AI-Powered Smart Note Taker**
Capture meeting notes or voice memos ‚Äî AI fills in the blanks with:
- Related videos, research papers, site references
- Summaries + links
- Think: Notion meets Perplexity

### 5. **Medical PDF Translator**
Upload medical PDFs and get quick, human-readable translations.
- Example use: translating post-hospital visit documents from French ‚Üí English
- Solves a real pain point (real story: A friend would got a $2,000 quote + it would've taken a week.)
- Not a replacement for legal/official medical interpretation

### 6. **Mental Health Meditation App**
Open-source, low-cost alternative to Calm/Headspace.
- Guided meditations
- AI chatbot for light support (marketed as clearly not a therapist)
- Built around accessibility and empathy

## üåü Project Values

- **Creativity > Perfection**: Done is better than perfect.
- **Collaborative Spirit**: Each dev builds on the last.
- **Transparency**: Leave clear documentation and reasoning behind every decision.
- **Vibes Welcome**: This is meant to be fun. Bring your weird.

## ‚è± Relay Format

Each developer gets ~2 hours to work before handing off. Here's the full relay breakdown:

| Dev # | Role |
|-------|------|
| 1     | Planning (Concept + MVP + PDR) ‚úÖ |
| 2     | Frontend skeleton |
| 3     | Design & branding |
| 4     | Backend & APIs |
| 5     | Auth & security |
| 6     | QA, launch, and prep for Product Hunt/demo |

All work is streamed or recorded for a final YouTube recap.

## üé• Final Product

At the end, we'll have:
- A working MVP
- A full build journey recorded
- A 20-minute video documenting the entire project
- A public repo and possibly a **Product Hunt launch**
