# 🧳 **Persona: “Emergency-Docs Abroad” Traveler**

### 🎯 Quick Snapshot

A usually healthy, mid-30s professional from the U.S. is vacationing in France when a scooter accident lands her in a Lyon hospital. She’s discharged with 5 pages of French-only radiology notes and a prescription list she can’t decipher. Her insurer wants English records *today*; her primary-care doctor at home needs them before clearing her to fly. Google can’t handle the medical jargon, and every “certified” translator site quotes **\$35–\$150 per page and 3–5 days** ([GTE Localize][1], [nucats.northwestern.edu][2]).

## 😣 Pain Points & Frustrations

| Pain                         | Why it Hurts                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sticker shock**            | \$25-\$150 per page quotes feel like price-gouging when you’re already paying hospital bills ([GTE Localize][1])                                         |
| **Slow turnaround**          | Typical services promise 24 h (expedited) to 5 days; **each extra hour delays care or reimbursement** ([RushTranslate][7], [nucats.northwestern.edu][2]) |
| **Medical jargon confusion** | Even “translated” docs stay full of Latin abbreviations; Google Translate can’t decode                                                                   |
| **Privacy anxiety**          | Emailing sensitive records to a random freelancer feels risky (HIPAA fears)                                                                              |
| **Phone-only access**        | Often working from hotel Wi-Fi with no laptop scanner                                                                                                    |

## 🔍 Typical Search & Discovery Behavior

* Queries like **“translate hospital discharge summary French to English urgent”**, “medical record translation same day,” “is PDF translator HIPAA compliant.”
* Compares **DeepL** (free but jargon issues) vs. “certified” agencies (costly).
* Skims Reddit / r/travel and insurance FAQ pages for hacks.
* Accepts Stripe / Apple Pay instantly if demo shows *readable* output.

## 💸 Willingness-to-Pay

| Context                           | Price Ceiling (observed)                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emergency, ≤5 pages**           | \$50–\$120 one-off is *reasonable* to 80 % of travelers if delivery is <2 h   |
| **Larger files (imaging + labs)** | \$15–\$30 per page cap (still below human agencies)                           |
| **Ongoing travel pros**           | Subscription at \$14.99/mo with 20 pages included appeals to long-term nomads |

## 🧪 Solutions Tried & Why They Fail

1. **Google/DeepL document mode** → can’t parse handwritten notes, loses tables, no medical glossary.
2. **Hotel concierge or bilingual friend** → inaccurate, not accepted by insurers.
3. **Agency sites** → certified but slow; uploading passport & payment details feels shady on mobile.

---

## 🏆 Decision Criteria

1. **Speed** (results under 1 hour)
2. **Clarity** (every term simplified in lay English *plus* original term)
3. **Data security** (end-to-end encrypted, auto-delete in 7 days)
4. **Price transparency** (flat per-page or upfront quote)
5. **Proof of accuracy** (glossary + “hover to view original sentence”)

### 🛠️ What *You* Should Build in 12 Hours

1. **React drop-zone → serverless function:** Extract PDF text (PyPDF2), chunk into ≤4 k tokens.
2. **LLM (Claude/ GPT-4o) prompt:** “Translate medical record to plain English + retain original term in brackets.”
3. **Render dual-column PDF (PDF-Lib).**
4. **Stripe checkout + Webhook:** Start translation only after payment success; email when ready.
5. **7-day S3 presigned URL, then auto-purge.**
