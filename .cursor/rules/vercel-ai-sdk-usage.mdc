# Vercel AI SDK Usage Guide

This project leverages the Vercel AI SDK to enable document translation workflows, specifically targeting images and PDFs. The following summarizes the key usage patterns and architecture:

- **Translation Workflow:**
  - Users upload documents (images or PDFs) to the application.
  - The uploaded files are processed and sent to the Vercel AI SDK, utilizing the **Mistral model** for language translation.
  - The AI model extracts text from the document, translates it into the target language, and returns the translated content.

- **File Storage and Sharing:**
  - Processed files (original and/or translated) are stored using the **Vercel blob store**.
  - The blob store generates a **shareable link** for each stored file, which can be distributed to users for access.

- **Key Implementation Details:**
  - The Vercel AI SDK is integrated in the backend logic responsible for handling file uploads and translation requests.
  - The Mistral model is explicitly selected/configured for translation tasks.
  - After translation, the result (text or file) is saved to the blob store, and a link is generated for sharing.

- **Extending the Workflow:**
  - Agents or developers can build on this foundation by adding post-processing steps, additional language support, or further automations after the image/PDF is processed and saved.
  - The shareable link mechanism enables easy distribution and further actions on the translated documents.

Refer to the relevant backend logic and blob store integration for implementation specifics.
